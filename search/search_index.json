Features prometheus ( Sink ) This sink publishes events processed by Siddhi into Prometheus metrics and exposes them to the Prometheus server at the specified URL. The created metrics can be published to Prometheus via 'server' or 'pushGateway', depending on your preference. The metric types that are supported by the Prometheus sink are 'counter', 'gauge', 'histogram', and 'summary'. The values and labels of the Prometheus metrics can be updated through the events. prometheus ( Source ) This source consumes Prometheus metrics that are exported from a specified URL as Siddhi events by sending HTTP requests to the URL. Based on the source configuration, it analyzes metrics from the text response and sends them as Siddhi events through key-value mapping.The user can retrieve metrics of the 'including', 'counter', 'gauge', 'histogram', and 'summary' types. The source retrieves the metrics from a text response of the target. Therefore, it is you need to use 'string' as the attribute type for the attributes that correspond with the Prometheus metric labels. Further, the Prometheus metric value is passed through the event as 'value'. This requires you to include an attribute named 'value' in the stream definition. The supported types for the 'value' attribute are 'INT', 'LONG', 'FLOAT', and 'DOUBLE'. Dependencies Prometheus server instance should be started. Prometheus Pushgateway should be started.

The metric is exposed through an http server at the target url. EXAMPLE 2 @sink(type='prometheus',job='inventoryLevel', push.url='http://localhost:9080', publish.mode='pushGateway', metric.type='gauge', metric.help= 'Current level of inventory', @map(type='keyvalue')) define stream InventoryLevelStream (Name String, value int); In the above example, the Prometheus-sink creates a gauge metric with the stream name and defined attributes as labels.The metric is pushed to Prometheus pushGateway at the target url. Source prometheus (Source) The source consumes Prometheus metrics which are exported from the specified url as Siddhi events, by making http requests to the url. According to the source configuration, it analyses metrics from the text response and sends them as Siddhi events through key-value mapping.The user can retrieve metrics of types including, counter, gauge, histogram and summary. Since the source retrieves the metrics from a text response of the target, it is advised to use 'string' as the attribute type for the attributes that correspond to Prometheus metric labels. Further, the Prometheus metric value is passed through the event as 'value'. Therefore, it is advisable to have an attribute with the name 'value' in the stream. The supported types for the attribute, 'value' are INT, LONG, FLOAT and DOUBLE.

Source prometheus (Source) This source consumes Prometheus metrics that are exported from a specified URL as Siddhi events by sending HTTP requests to the URL. Based on the source configuration, it analyzes metrics from the text response and sends them as Siddhi events through key-value mapping.The user can retrieve metrics of the 'including', 'counter', 'gauge', 'histogram', and 'summary' types. The source retrieves the metrics from a text response of the target. Therefore, it is you need to use 'string' as the attribute type for the attributes that correspond with the Prometheus metric labels. Further, the Prometheus metric value is passed through the event as 'value'. This requires you to include an attribute named 'value' in the stream definition. The supported types for the 'value' attribute are 'INT', 'LONG', 'FLOAT', and 'DOUBLE'.

The expected format of the grouping key is as follows: \"'key1:value1','key2:value2'\" . null Any key value pairs in the supported format Examples EXAMPLE 1 @sink(type='prometheus',job='fooOrderCount', server.url ='http://localhost:9080', publish.mode='server', metric.type='counter', metric.help= 'Number of foo orders', @map(type='keyvalue')) define stream FooCountStream (Name String, quantity int, value int); In the above example, the Prometheus-sink creates a counter metric with the stream name and defined attributes as labels. The metric is exposed through an HTTP server at the target URL. EXAMPLE 2 @sink(type='prometheus',job='inventoryLevel', push.url='http://localhost:9080', publish.mode='pushGateway', metric.type='gauge', metric.help= 'Current level of inventory', @map(type='keyvalue')) define stream InventoryLevelStream (Name String, value int); In the above example, the Prometheus-sink creates a gauge metric with the stream name and defined attributes as labels.The metric is pushed to the Prometheus pushGateway at the target URL.","title":"prometheus (Sink)"},{"location":"api/latest/#source","text":"","title":"Source"},{"location":"api/latest/#prometheus-source","text":"This source consumes Prometheus metrics that are exported from a specified URL as Siddhi events by sending HTTP requests to the URL. Based on the source configuration, it analyzes metrics from the text response and sends them as Siddhi events through key-value mapping.The user can retrieve metrics of the 'including', 'counter', 'gauge', 'histogram', and 'summary' types. The source retrieves the metrics from a text response of the target. Therefore, it is you need to use 'string' as the attribute type for the attributes that correspond with the Prometheus metric labels. Further, the Prometheus metric value is passed through the event as 'value'. This requires you to include an attribute named 'value' in the stream definition. The supported types for the 'value' attribute are 'INT', 'LONG', 'FLOAT', and 'DOUBLE'.

The supported metric types are 'counter', 'gauge',\" 'histogram', and 'summary'. STRING No No username This property specifies the username that needs to be added in the authorization header of the HTTP request if basic authentication is enabled at the target. It is required to specify both the username and the password to enable basic authentication. If you do not provide a value for one or both of these parameters, an error is logged in the console. STRING Yes No password This property specifies the password that needs to be added in the authorization header of the HTTP request if basic authentication is enabled at the target. It is required to specify both the username and the password to enable basic authentication. If you do not provide a value for one or both of these parameters, an error is logged in the console. STRING Yes No client.truststore.file The file path to the location of the truststore to which the client needs to send HTTPS requests via the 'HTTPS' protocol. STRING Yes No client.truststore.password The password for the client-truststore. This is required to send HTTPS requests. A custom password can be specified if required. STRING Yes No headers Headers that need to be included as HTTP request headers in the request. The format of the supported input is as follows, \"'header1:value1','header2:value2'\" STRING Yes No job This property defines the job name of the exported Prometheus metrics that needs to be fetched. STRING Yes No instance This property defines the instance of the exported Prometheus metrics that needs to be fetched. STRING Yes No grouping.key This parameter specifies the grouping key of the required metrics in key-value pairs. The grouping key is used if the metrics are exported by Prometheus 'pushGateway' in order to distinguish those metrics from already existing metrics. The expected format of the grouping key is as follows: \"'key1:value1','key2:value2'\" STRING Yes No System Parameters Name Description Default Value Possible Parameters scrapeInterval The default time interval in seconds for the Prometheus source to send HTTP requests to the target URL. 60 Any integer value scrapeTimeout The default time duration (in seconds) for an HTTP request to time-out if the server at the URL does not respond. 10 Any integer value scheme The scheme of the target for the Prometheus source to send HTTP requests. The supported schemes are 'HTTP' and 'HTTPS'.
